My lord and gentlemen, upwards of 5 minutes had passed in this altercation, and the noise in some measure had subsided; but some gentlemen, who had lost their property at the play-house that night, hearing a rumour, came immediately and declared, if there was a suspected person there, it was necessary he should give satisfaction and clear himself; that he should retire to some place and be searched; to this I assented, and was retiring at the time with several people who were there, when we were met by the constable, who told me I must go before Sir \n",

Give an account of what happened there, and the manner in which the deceased got the wound of which he died. - About half past 12 at night on the 28th of last month, as I was sitting up waiting for a gentleman who lodged at my house, there came some people to my door who demanded admission, which I refused, desiring to know who they were; I did not choose to open my door to any but those I knew something of; they refused to give any other account than that he was a gentleman and an officer, but no name was given; I still repeated, I would not open the door to any body I did not know; the deceased immediately, with great violence, forced it open from its then fastening; he burst the door open about 18 inches; I got it shut with great difficulty, and put up the iron bar; when he found the door was made fast again he called out, D - n your blood, you are only a rascally waiter, and I will be revenged of your master to-morrow, and with great violence kicked at the door and stove the bottom pannel; I could no longer bear to have my door broke to pieces: I took up this stick (a very large one) and opened the door with the stick in my hand; the first thing that I saw was the deceased with his drawn sword; he made a lunge at my body; I warded off that, and many chops and thrusts, the marks of which are to be seen upon this stick; this created a very great noise; Mr. Storer was then gone up stairs to go to bed; he called out, White, what is the matter? I don't know that I made him any answer, if I did, I know not what it was, but very soon Mr. Storer came down with a pistol in his hand, and his servant attended him; Mr. Storer was in his night-gown and night-cap without his stockings; he came forward and demanded of the person who I was then engaged with, who he was, and what he wanted; the deceased immediately left me and made a thrust at Mr. Storer.</p>\n",
              "<p>Where was Mr. Storer standing at that time? - In the middle of the passage; he retreated on seeing the sword pushed at him, and told the deceased, if he did not desist he should be obliged to shoot him; the deceased said, shoot and be d - d, and continued pushing; Mr. Storer repeated those words twice or three times, that he should be obliged to shoot him if he did not desist.</p>\n",
